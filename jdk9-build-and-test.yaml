        * This jobs builds the jdk images and runs tests and benchmarks against the built images.<br>
        * <b>Note:</b> this job is usually triggered by a source change (ie. the "jdk9-update-src-tree" job).<br>
        If it is run manually it will use the source tarball from the last successful build of that job.<br>
        * If this jobs runs to completion the results are published to http://openjdk.linaro.org/.
